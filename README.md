# Experiment for undergraduate disseration
## 1. Introduction
This library is a derivative of the LibAUC library, a deep learning library designed for X-Risk Optimization. I have made several revisions to its files to suit the requirements of my experiment.

## 2. Requirements
The dependencies include pandas, scipy, numpy, and pytorch, as well as all other libraries required by the original LibAUC. Additionally, the CheXpert datasets are needed, which should include a train_valid_test.csv file, along with train and valid folders.
